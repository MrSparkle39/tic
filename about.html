                    <h2>Our Story: Building a Legacy of Support</h2>
                    <p class="lead">The Inclusion Crew was founded on a simple but powerful belief: everyone deserves the opportunity to live their best life, with dignity, choice, and independence.</p>
                    
                    <p>What started as a small team of passionate disability support workers has grown into a comprehensive NDIS service provider, serving participants across Australia. Our journey has been shaped by the incredible people we support, their families, and our dedicated team members who bring their hearts to work every single day.</p>
                    
                    <p>Over the years, we've learned that the best disability support isn't about following a one-size-fits-all approach. It's about listening, understanding, adapting, and growing alongside the people we serve. Every participant teaches us something new, and every challenge makes us better at what we do.</p>
                    
                    <p>Today, The Inclusion Crew stands as a testament to what's possible when you combine professional expertise with genuine care, innovation with tradition, and structure with flexibility. We've built our reputation on reliability, quality, and most importantly, on the relationships we've formed with our participants and their families.</p>
                    
                    <p>As a registered NDIS provider, we maintain the highest standards of compliance and quality while never losing sight of what really matters: the individual people we support and their unique goals, dreams, and aspirations.</p>
